TRIGGER RUN SIZES (TAHLTON PROPORTIONS)

Trigger run size code for the cpue-catch Stikine management model (SFMM Catch-CPUE model). The D106-41 and D108 Tahltan proportions are modelled. From 2014-2016, the models used data from 1994-2013. In 2017, the Tah proportions were updated to include data from 1994-2016. The data through 2011 is from SPA and the data from 2012 on is from GSI.The smm-historical model does not use modeled proportions. The Scform sheet in the SFMM Catch-CPUE model needs to be updated with the Tah proportions when the triggers are updated.
