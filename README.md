# Stikine-management-model
TRIGGER RUN SIZES (TAHLTAN PROPORTIONS)

Trigger run size code for the cpue-catch Stikine management model (SFMM Catch-CPUE model). The D106-41 and D108 Tahltan proportions are modelled. From 2014-2016, the models used data from 1994-2013. In 2017, the Tah proportions were updated to include data from 1994-2016. The data through 2011 is from SPA and the data from 2012 on is from GSI. The smm-historical model does not use modelled proportions. The D108 and D10641 datasheets need to be updated so that the Scform sheet in the SFMM Catch-CPUE model is updated with the Tah proportions. The Scform sheet is linked to the D108 and D10641 datasheets.
